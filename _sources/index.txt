Welcome to the documentation for Erebot_Module_RateLimiter!
===========================================================

Erebot_Module_RateLimiter is a module for `Erebot`_ that can limit the bot's
output rate so as to prevent it from flooding IRC servers.

The algorithm used is really basic and won't protect it against carefully
planned attacks (:abbr:`DoS (Denial of Service)`), but it is still better
than having nothing at all.
