Controls the rate of outgoing messages

This modules implements a simple rate-limiting strategy for outgoing
IRC messages. It is used by connections to determine whether they can
continue to send messages or if they should delay that operation
instead.

This module only needs to be active on connections that must be
throttled and provides two options to decide how many messages may
be sent to a connection per time period.
