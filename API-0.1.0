The API never changed since this module was first written...
I guess this module could be marked as stable.

This module provides the following useful public methods:
-   getNetPassword()
-   getBotNickname()
-   getBotIdentity()
-   getBotHostname()
-   getBotRealname()

It also provides the following protected method:
-   sendCredentials()
